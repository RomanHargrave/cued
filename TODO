make dist
    LICENSE and COPYING missing
        COPYING missing b/c of foreign flag

    make directory is missing
        might want flac*
            how do I include extra files in subdir?
                a Makefile.am just for that dir?  or can use path syntax in parent dir?

use version number from config.h and remove from cued.h
    have cued.h include config.h?

    already have a conflict in rip.c which includes both cued.h and config.h
        (for mmc_ll*h)

more conversions %z vs. %l ?
    does this show up on 32-bit system?

AC_ARG_ENABLE for --enable
    can set up debug malloc stuff with this

    run ifnames */*c */*h | fgrep -v INCLUDED

AC_ARG_WITH for --with

classc
    need m4 rules in makefiles
        can include foo.am during automake?

    AC_PROG_LEX AC_PROG_YACC are options as well

    ob.h and firstcls.h will need delete rules in makefile
