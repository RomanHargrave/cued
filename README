BUILDING

    Cued was developed with the following libraries:

        libcdio     version 0.78.2
        libsndfile  version 1.0.17
        libcddb     version 1.3.0

    You can build the release by running GNU make.  On most systems
    this is either simply "make" or "gmake."

INSTALLING

    To install in /usr/local/bin:
        make install

    To install elsewhere:
        INSTALL_DIR="/some/place/bin" make install

RIPPING

    This is how the author rips a disc (2 steps:)

        1. cued -o 12 -vipx -c "%D/%Y<%Y - >%C/%C (%M)" -n "%D/%Y<%Y - >%C/%N%N<<00> - %A<%A - >%T%N< (%L)>" -t "artist=%A%A<<%D>" -t "title=%T" -t "album=%C" -t "date=%Y" -t "year=%Y" -t "tracknumber=%N%N<<00>" -t "track=%N%N<<00>" -t "genre=%B" -t "freedb=%F" -t "comment=cued%V" -t "comment=%S" /dev/cdrom

        2. make -f make/flac.mk

        Add 30 to cued -o to match EAC with is skewed from "absolute zero"
        by -30.  Note that ARCue.pl will fail if you do not add 30
        to the offset.  Or, better yet, use notdown in the "accurip" directory.
        Notdown recognizes that the Accurate Rip database is off by 30.

    Help on formats:

        If track is zero, use 00 for track number, else use track number:
            %N%N<<00>

        If track artist is empty, use disc artist:
            %A%A<<%D>

        If track artist is provided, then include it.
            %A<%A - >

            This is useful for compilations of various artists.

        Test tags without ripping:
            cued -n "%D/%Y<%Y - >%C/%N%N<<00> - %A<%A - >%T%N< (%L)>" -t "artist=%A%A<<%D>" -t "title=%T" -t "album=%C" -t "date=%Y" -t "year=%Y" -t "tracknumber=%N%N<<00>" -t "track=%N%N<<00>" -t "genre=%B" -t "freedb=%F" -t "comment=cued%V" -t "comment=%S" /dev/cdrom
