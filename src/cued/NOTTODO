create toc file (-t)
    why not?
        cue sheet is well supported by cdrdao

add alternate Q subchannel read method?

    why not?
        too complicated and newer drives support mmc read

    use DAP and position commands

    10% of track back until index that is non-zero found, then read forward?

    use binary search?
        left val/right val
            search until left val is 1, right val is 2 (lsn diff==1)

            always work left which is reading BACKWARDS, but then read forward

        what to do for missing qsc entries?
            scan right until found
                what if it scans all the way to end without getting a valid qsc record?
                    then scan left?

    use heuristic?
        5%, 15%, 35%, 65%, etc. before beginning of track

    build in memory search tree
        check tree before checking disc
