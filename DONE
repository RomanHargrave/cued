AM_CFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/lib 
cued_LDADD = $(LIBCDIO_LIBS) $(LIBCDIOPARANOIA_LIBS) $(LIBSNDFILE_LIBS) $(LIBCDDB_LIBS) $(top_builddir)/lib/libcued.a $(AM_LDFLAGS)

    should we be using @AM_CFLAGS@ or $(AM_CFLAGS) in Makefile.am?
        @AM_CFLAGS@ substitituion is at automake time
        $(AM_CFLAGS) happens when running Makefile
            using the latter gives a recursion problem in Makefile

    AM_CFLAGS or AM_CPPFLAGS?
        AM_CPPFLAGS

AC_LANG_C seems superfluous now with AC_PROG_CC which seems to test the compiler anyway

is AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE called correctly?

add foreign option to AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE so autoreconf --force --install will work?

automake takes a -Wall flag

topbuilddir vs topsrcdir?
    matters for VPATH

need cdio libs as well as paranoia libs in cued/Makefile.am?
    not technically, but is more explicit

should have a src sub-directory
    config.h should be generated here

lib directory should be under lib, not src

PACKAGE_BUGREPORT:  does code have hydrologiccycle@gmail.com in it?
    no

is the compiler gcc?
    -Wall -Wstrict-aliasing=2 and -Wformat=2
    -Wformat-security
    -Wstrict-aliasing=3 ?
    -Wextra?  no.

    g++

    gnu89/98/etc.

make dist
    need .h files as part of _SOURCES for cued and lib?
        yes

    do I need dist_noinst_SCRIPTS = autogen.sh and rebuild.sh?
        did not copy

    make directory is missing
        might want flac*
            how do I include extra files in subdir?
                a Makefile.am just for that dir?  or can use path syntax in parent dir?

                yes, can use EXTRA_DIST at any level

    LICENSE and COPYING missing
        COPYING missing b/c of foreign flag
