2.2. Are there any naming-rules for submitting CD's to freedb?
Yes, there are:

   1. Never submit info completely in capitals or completely lower case, if there is no special reason for that.
   2. For bands that have a leading "the", simply leave out the "the" (e.g. use "Rolling Stones" instead of "The Rolling Stones") (this rule does not apply to "The The" ;-)
   3. Names of people should be written "first name last name" - NOT "last name, first name".
   4. Use the name of the artist repeated on the "title" field if there is no title (usually seen on an artist's first major label release, such as with the B-52's)
   5. When submitting a CD-Extra, name the data-track "Data" or something like that - do not leave the track-title blank.
   6. When submitting a sampler or compilation, you should include the track-artist in the track-name, using the syntax "artist / track-title" and set the CD-artist to "Various"
