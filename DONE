classc
    need m4 rules in makefiles
        can include foo.am during automake?

    AC_PROG_LEX AC_PROG_YACC are options as well

    ob.h and firstcls.h will need delete rules in makefile

    make class compilation conditional
        note that always have to make makefiles for classc b/c conditional around SUBDIRS doesn't work correctly in case of make maintainer-clean
        
        Solaris does not have AM_COND_IF macro

    handle variants of m4
        use -g flag?

out of directory build
    cannot find cued_config.h

AM_CFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/lib 
cued_LDADD = $(LIBCDIO_LIBS) $(LIBCDIOPARANOIA_LIBS) $(LIBSNDFILE_LIBS) $(LIBCDDB_LIBS) $(top_builddir)/lib/libcued.a $(AM_LDFLAGS)

    should we be using @AM_CFLAGS@ or $(AM_CFLAGS) in Makefile.am?
        @AM_CFLAGS@ substitituion is at automake time
        $(AM_CFLAGS) happens when running Makefile
            using the latter gives a recursion problem in Makefile

    AM_CFLAGS or AM_CPPFLAGS?
        AM_CPPFLAGS

AC_LANG_C seems superfluous now with AC_PROG_CC which seems to test the compiler anyway

is AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE called correctly?

add foreign option to AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE so autoreconf --force --install will work?

automake takes a -Wall flag

topbuilddir vs topsrcdir?
    matters for VPATH

need cdio libs as well as paranoia libs in cued/Makefile.am?
    not technically, but is more explicit

should have a src sub-directory
    config.h should be generated here

lib directory should be under lib, not src

PACKAGE_BUGREPORT:  does code have hydrologiccycle@gmail.com in it?
    no

is the compiler gcc?
    -Wall -Wstrict-aliasing=2 and -Wformat=2
    -Wformat-security
    -Wstrict-aliasing=3 ?
    -Wextra?  no.

    g++

    gnu89/98/etc.

make dist
    need .h files as part of _SOURCES for cued and lib?
        yes

    do I need dist_noinst_SCRIPTS = autogen.sh and rebuild.sh?
        did not copy

    make directory is missing
        might want flac*
            how do I include extra files in subdir?
                a Makefile.am just for that dir?  or can use path syntax in parent dir?

                yes, can use EXTRA_DIST at any level

    LICENSE and COPYING missing
        COPYING missing b/c of foreign flag

use version number from config.h and remove from cued.h
    have cued.h include config.h?

    already have a conflict in rip.c which includes both cued.h and config.h
        (for mmc_ll*h)

AC_ARG_ENABLE for --enable
    can set up debug malloc stuff with this

more conversions %z vs. %l ?
    does this show up on 32-bit system?
        yes

use m4sh test/if macros

create cued_config.h instead of config.h
    also, prefix with CUED_ ?
        The transformation is done inside include/cdio/Makefile.am. For GNU/Linux,
        the relevant portion expands in Makefile to:

              @/bin/sed -r -e 's/^(#[ \t]*define) /\1 CDIO_/'
        $(top_builddir)/config.h >>cdio_config.h

add autogen.sh and maybe rebuild.sh to dist
        dist_noinst_SCRIPTS = autogen.sh

        how is this different from EXTRA_DIST?

        something_libincludedir = $(libdir)/something-1.0/include
        nodist_something_libinclude_HEADERS = config.h

include standard header macros?
    is there such a thing?
