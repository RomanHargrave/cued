AM_CFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/lib 
cued_LDADD = $(LIBCDIO_LIBS) $(LIBCDIOPARANOIA_LIBS) $(LIBSNDFILE_LIBS) $(LIBCDDB_LIBS) $(top_builddir)/lib/libcued.a $(AM_LDFLAGS)

    should we be using @AM_CFLAGS@ or $(AM_CFLAGS) in Makefile.am?
        @AM_CFLAGS@ substitituion is at automake time
        $(AM_CFLAGS) happens when running Makefile
            using the latter gives a recursion problem in Makefile

    AM_CFLAGS or AM_CPPFLAGS?
        AM_CPPFLAGS

AC_LANG_C seems superfluous now with AC_PROG_CC which seems to test the compiler anyway

is AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE called correctly?

add foreign option to AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE so autoreconf --force --install will work?

automake takes a -Wall flag

topbuilddir vs topsrcdir?
    matters for VPATH

need cdio libs as well as paranoia libs in cued/Makefile.am?
    not technically, but is more explicit
