add autogen.sh and maybe rebuild.sh to dist
        dist_noinst_SCRIPTS = autogen.sh

        how is this different from EXTRA_DIST?

        something_libincludedir = $(libdir)/something-1.0/include
        nodist_something_libinclude_HEADERS = config.h

run ifnames */*c */*h | fgrep -v INCLUDED

include standard header macros?
    is there such a thing?

classc
    need m4 rules in makefiles
        can include foo.am during automake?

    AC_PROG_LEX AC_PROG_YACC are options as well

    ob.h and firstcls.h will need delete rules in makefile

find a way to test compiler flags (sfcmp: -Wno-unused-but-set-var)
    read macro list for autoconf and automake to learn possibilities

    see configure.ac in libcdio
