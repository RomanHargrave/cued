run ifnames */*c */*h | fgrep -v INCLUDED

include standard header macros?

classc
    need m4 rules in makefiles
        can include foo.am during automake?

    AC_PROG_LEX AC_PROG_YACC are options as well

    ob.h and firstcls.h will need delete rules in makefile

find a way to test compiler flags (sfcmp: -Wno-unused-but-set-var)
    read macro list for autoconf and automake to learn possibilities
